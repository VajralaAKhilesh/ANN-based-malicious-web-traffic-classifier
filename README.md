# ANN-based Malicious Web Traffic Classifier

This project implements an AI-driven Intrusion Detection System (IDS) using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to classify network traffic as malicious or benign. It focuses on detecting malicious web traffic effectively to enhance cybersecurity measures.

## Overview

With the rising sophistication of cyberattacks, traditional signature-based detection systems struggle to identify novel threats. This project leverages machine learning to analyze network traffic patterns and accurately classify them, enabling proactive defense against malicious activities.

## Features

- Utilizes ANN to classify network traffic into malicious or non-malicious categories.
- Performs detailed traffic analysis on DNS over HTTPS (DoH) attacks and other web traffic.
- Real-time detection capabilities to improve network security.
- Easily extensible for other intrusion detection datasets and scenarios.

## Dataset

The dataset used consists of labeled network traffic samples capturing both benign and malicious behavior. The data preprocessing, feature extraction, and normalization steps are implemented to optimize model performance.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VajralaAKhilesh/ANN-based-malicious-web-traffic-classifier.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd ANN-based-malicious-web-traffic-classifier

3. Open and run the Jupyter notebook NEW_Research.ipynb to explore the data, train the model, and evaluate results.

## Requirements
    Python 3.x
    Jupyter Notebook
    TensorFlow / Keras
    NumPy
    Pandas
    Scikit-learn
    Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## Results:
The trained ANN model demonstrates high accuracy and precision in detecting malicious web traffic, effectively distinguishing between benign and attack traffic.
